# Assignment One

This assignment is designed to allow you to demonstrate your skill and understanding over State and Props in React Js.

### Task:

- Create a new project with CRA (create-react-app).
- Make 1 component named MyComponent. This component should display 2 things. Name of the page e.g: Home, Contact and information related to the page. But remember, we will not create two separate component for this. We will allow a particular component to take those 2 values via props and show it inside the component.
- Make App.js as our parent component. There will be two button for two different page. One is Home and Another one is contact. When a particular button is clicked, it should update a related state with relevant information e.g: the data we want to show in MyComponent.
- Whenever a particular button is clicked, the state should be updated and the state value should be passed to MyComponent as props and display them.
